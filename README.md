# BAMAZON!
## Like Amazon... if it was made by Emeril Lagasse. BAM!

Here's the gist of it.
* You log on.
* You see what's for sale.
* Pick what you want to buy and type in the ID.
  * Don't you worry about the money, it's all fake! Treat Yo Self!
* Pick how many.
* You'll either be alerted if it's out of stock or if its on its way!
* And it will show up at your door in infinity+1 days!

### "Git" it installed
To install Bamazon, you first need to read this list of stuff:
* Clone/Fork the repo
* Locate recently cloned repo in terminal
* Run this code:

        npm install

    * That should get you everything you need.

* Now run this code to lanch the app:

        node bamazonCustomer.js

* Lastly, have fun. Life is short, buy a plumbus.
